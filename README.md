# Arturia_Beatstep_for_Video_Editor
;I'm not, by any means, a programmer, I'm a video editor and I saw this one video on youtube where an Arturia Beatstep was used
;for video editing and color grading and decided to give it a shot programming some scripts to control Adobe Premiere Pro and
;Davinci Resolve.
;------------------------------
;The general idea is to take some Midi input and convert so Premiere Pro can make use of it to control its functions.
;------------------------------
;Right now the file only works with Adobe Premiere Pro, but I'd like to expand it's functionality to Resolve and other software.
;It works with AHK calling some actions and presets, some mine, some from other people, all credited inside the document (I hope).
;My knowledge of programming is very limited but I'd like to improve this.
